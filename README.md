# My First Rust Project

This is a simple, lightweight command line interpreter with Unix-like built-in commands, created for familiarizing myself with Rust.

## Command Interpreter Notes

### 1. Variable Assignment and Evaluation
You can assign variables and use them in commands:
```shell
i = 5; echo $i
```
#### Variable Scope
Variable scope is limited to the `( )` block. If a variable `$VAR` is not found in the current scope, the interpreter searches the parent (enclosing) scope and continues up to the top.

### 2. Expressions
#### a) Conditional Statements
Use the following structure for if/else:
```shell
if ( <condition> ) ( <body> ) [ else ( <body> ) ]
```
##### Example:
```shell
i = 3; if ($i > 0) (echo "i is positive") else (echo "i is not positive")
```

#### b) Loops
**While Loop:**
```shell
while ( <condition> ) ( <body> )
```
##### Example:
```shell
i = 3;
while ($i > 0) (echo $i; $i = $i - 1)
```

**For Loop:**
```shell
for VAR in [list]; ( <body> )
```
```
for f in *.rs; ( echo $f; ls -l $f )
```

#### c) Arithmetic Operations
Supported operations: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`

#### d) Logical Operations
Supported operations: `||`, `&&`

### 3. Command Execution Evaluation
- A command evaluates to true if it succeeds (exit code 0) and false otherwise.
- Errors from failed commands are stored in the special variable `$__errors` if their status was evaluated.
- If a command fails and its status is not evaluated or assigned, execution stops.

#### Example Error Handling:
```shell
if (cp source/path dest/path) (echo "Ok") else (echo $__errors)
```

### 4. Redirects
Use the following operators for redirects:
- Output to file: `command => file`
- Append to file: `command =>> file`

### 5. Pipes
Pipe output between commands:
```shell
<expression> | <expression>
```
##### Example:
```shell
ls -al | (echo "\t\tHEADER"; cat; echo "\t\tFOOTER")
```
Example for variable assignment:
```shell
realpath .. | x; echo $x
```

### 6. Special Variables
Use the following special variables for redirecting output:
- Redirect stdout: `$__stdout`
- Redirect stderr: `$__stderr`

##### Examples:
```shell
__stderr=null; ls;
__stderr=log.txt; ls -al;
__stderr=$__stdout; ls -al /
__stdout=some/path/file.txt ls -al;
```

### 7. Gotchas and Pitfalls
- **Variable Expansion in Arithmetic:**
  - `2*3` evaluates to `6`, but `x=2; y=3; $x*$y` evaluates to `2*3`.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Redirecting `$__stderr` and `$__stdout` to each other in the same scope is undefined.
- **Command Assignment:** Assigning a command to a variable (e.g., `x = command`) results in `0` or `1`, not the command's output.

### 8. Variable Parsing and Expansion
This section details the parsing and expanding of shell-like variable expressions in a given string.

### Notes:
- **Grouping and Escaping:** Groups in substitution must be enclosed in quotes, and captures need to be double escaped.
- **Examples of Variable Expansion:**
  - Basic variable expansion:
    ```shell
    "${NAME}"         -> "John Doe"
    "$GREETING"       -> "Hello, World!"
    ```
  - Variable substitution:
    ```shell
    "${NAME/John/Jane}"            -> "Jane Doe"
    "${GREETING/World/Universe}"   -> "Hello, Universe!"
    ```
  - Capture groups in substitution:
    ```shell
    "${NAME/(\\w+) (\\w+)/\\2, \\1}"   -> "Doe, John"
    "${GREETING/(Hello), (World)!/\\2 says \\1}" -> "World says Hello"
    ```
  - Handling non-existent variables:
    ```shell
    "${UNDEFINED_VAR}"             -> ""
    "${UNDEFINED_VAR/foo/bar}"     -> ""
    ```
